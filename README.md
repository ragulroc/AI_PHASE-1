## Overview

Gender Image Classifier is a deep learning project that uses machine learning to identify the gender (male or female) of individuals in images. This tool can be used for a wide range of applications, including facial recognition, demographic analysis, and more.

## Installation

To get started with the Gender Image Classifier project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gender-image-classifier.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights (if provided) or train your own model using the instructions in the `Model` section.

4. You are now ready to use the project for gender image classification.

## Usage

1. Use the pre-trained model:
   - Load the pre-trained model.
   - Provide an image as input.
   - Get the predicted gender (male or female).

2. Train your own model:
   - If you want to train your own model, follow the instructions in the `Model` section to create and train your gender recognition model.

## Dataset

The accuracy of the gender recognition model depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training. Ensure that you have a well-labeled dataset containing images of individuals with clear gender distinctions.

## Model

You can use the provided pre-trained model, or you can train your own. Details on training a model and dataset preparation can be found in the [Model Training Guide](model_training.md).

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the open-source community for their contributions to machine learning and computer vision, which made this project possible.
